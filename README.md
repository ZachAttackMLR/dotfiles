# Zach Gorman's Dotfiles

I've put way more time and effort into these than I care to admit, but here they are in all their glory (or shame...
I'll leave that decision up to you).

Written on and for macOS using iTerm2. If you're interested in versions of these specifically on and for Ubuntu 19.10,
feel free to contact me, but most of it works out of the box (if you have the same packages installed).

## Inspired By

If you like any of these, you'll love where I copied a majority of them from.
