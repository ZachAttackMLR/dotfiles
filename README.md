# Zach Gorman's Dotfiles

I've put way more time and effort into these than I care to admit, but here they
are in all their glory (or shame... I'll leave that decision up to you).

Written on and for macOS using iTerm2. If you're interested in versions of these
specifically on and for Ubuntu 19.10, feel free to contact me, but most of it
works out of the box (if you have the same packages installed).

## Inspired By

If you like any of these, you'll love where I copied a majority of them from.
This is also the reason my files are split unorthodoxly between `.zshrc`, `.aliases`,
and `.zfunctions`. In my opinion this set up looks better than cramming everything
into `.zshrc`, and also allows for easier navigation to exactly what I want to edit.
Acknowledgements can be found throughout the files, but most of them reference
